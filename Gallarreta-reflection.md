#GPS 1.1 Reflection

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	I had my first pairing session before my GPS session, and I had found myself struggling with collaborating on GitHub.  I wasn’t really sure how to share a project with someone else.  There were also commands that I hadn’t used that much beforehand such as git clone and git fetch.  It was helpful to go over these and discuss what each of these commands does.  


2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	*how to add a collaborator to a repository
	*what comments in a pull request are for
	*the difference between git fetch and git pull
	*purpose of the license in GitHub 
	*whoever is working on a project needs to clone the repo to their local drive
	*how to resolve merge conflicts


3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

	*How do you add someone as a collaborator?
	*Is the command for cloning something ‘git clone’?
	*What is git commit -v?
	*What exactly does git push do?  Does it push changes to your local and remote repositories?
	*What does ‘insert emojis using :word: notation(important) mean?


4. What still confuses you about Git?

	*Can one clone a repository on GitHub to GitHub without cloning it to one’s local drive first?
	*Can one undo a commit?
	*Why exactly do we delete feature branches on GitHub?  It seems to me that these still remain on the local drive.  Is this correct?  Are there ever occasions when one might have to revert back to these feature branches?  Can one revert back to an earlier version of the master branch?


5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

	My first experience was a lot of fun!  I loved the flow of conversation and workflow with Mal.  We were able to build on each other’s understanding of things.  It was also very helpful to have Helin step in and explain things when we didn’t understand a concept/had questions.
