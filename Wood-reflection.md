**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was struggling with the concept of remote vs local repos and how they are connected. Some of the git commands made sense to me in theory, but, to solidify my understanding, I wanted to test them out. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Working hands-on with the material helped clarify the Git Workflow for me. Our guide explained some of the commands to us in a way that really clicked. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I was confused about why it is necessary to add a message when you "commit" and then also when you enter the Pull Request screen in Github. Our guide explained that this is because you often do multiple commits before creating a pull request. You can go back and review each of the commits to understand all of the changes that have been made (at each commit). 

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I have some confusion in different scenarious when it comes to merging branches, but for the most part I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts we covered. My pairing partner and I want to do some further research about the difference between git fetch and git pull.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was a lot of fun. It is really nice to work with someone who is learning all of this info at the same time I am learning it. Having a guide was really great. She helped clarify concepts and was there whenever we got stuck.
